1.  This time, I looked at the assignment far a head of time.  I also looked at the resources online
When it came to implementation, I spent a lot more time on my tests, less time on code, and
less time finding bugs.  I tried to write a test for each method, and get it to pass. I just
went through all of them.  I slowly added more features to thoe methods that needed it.

I'm pretty sure everything for the minus works.  I didn't get a chance to try the advanced version.

I tested my implementation by assertEquals(); a lot this time.  I like this because I can
zero in on an exact result that I want.  All of the methods have tests in Junit.  Another
new thing I did is start breaking down my test into individual behaviors of a method.  So one
method could have 3 or 4 separate testing blocks.

Once again, I think I should have worked on this for longer.  Also, i didn't really have
a good idea how I would implement the 4ary tree.  I got stuck for a while on a few null pointer
exceptions when I was bubbling up or bubbling down.  I didn't always have a clear idea of what
all of the steps involved were, so I didn't have a great idea how my implementation would turn out.

I leanrned a lot this assignment.  I learned how to do jar command to build the jar files.  I 
think I became much better at writing tests and slowly attacking a problem.  I learned that it
is imporant to exhaustively test your methods to make sure they are working properly.  I also
learned how to isolate a problem more quickly and think of why the problem arose in the 
first place, not just how to fix the mistake.

Next assignment I will read immediately.  Then I'll watch all of the material posted.  Next,
i've been trying to get off my computer more during class and I think it is helping because I am
taking more notes.  Also, I'm going to try to bang out the easy version quickly, so I can get
some bonus points.  Finally, I'm mainly going to thing of solving the problem through the test
I would write, instead of just the code.  Also, I want to develop a test writing sequence,
so I know what tests I will write so I can solve them in the right order and add complexity
as needed.
